<h2>FLIP</h2>

FLIP can simulate inheritance for diploid organisms with a variable number of genes, chromosomes and traits. Traits are simulated by combining genetic effects and random environmental effects. Genetic effects are simulated from genes with known effects and linkages and the optional addition of unlinked genes whose effects will generate desired means, variances and covariances.

In addition to linkage effects, FLIP can simulate imprinting, dominance and epistasis. Trait performance of simulated animals can demonstrate response to selection as well as inbreeding depression and heterosis.

Initially FLIP was developed by Robert Benson as a standalone application to be run in any Desktop computer supporting JDK 1.2 or Higher. Later on, FLIP was modified in order that it can become a web-based software as today is available.


<h2>FLIP WEB</h2>

This web application  allows multiple users sharing animales based on the same genetic definition to interact with each other to simulate  the growing and performance of simulated animals.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

FLIP is still being tested but it has been proved successfully with the following auxiliary software:

-JRE 1.5 or higher -Apache Tomcat 6.0 or 7.0 (FLIP does not work with Tomcat 8) -MySQL Server 5.5 or Higher
