FLIP_WEB

Initially FLIP was developed by Robert Benson as a standalone application to be run in any Desktop computer supporting JDK 1.2 or Higher. Later on, FLIP was modified in order that it can become a web-based software as today is available.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

FLIP is still being tested but it has been proved successfully with the following auxiliary software:

-JRE 1.5 or higher 
-Apache Tomcat 6.0 or 7.0 (FLIP does not work with Tomcat 8) 
-MySQL Server 5.5 or Higher

One of the installation steps of MySQL requires to set its root password. By Default, FLIP assumes this password is set as "FlipWeb". If you want to change it (This is recommendable), you need to update a global variable, named "password", which is hard coded. You can find it at /FlipWeb/src/edu/iastate/ansci/flip/database/DatabaseFlip.java (unpack war file)

Then, you need to download the following sql script: Flip_Database_2016_01_05_No_Examples.sql. A simply way to execute it is by opening a OS terminal and from there to execute this script. Example: %> mysql -u root -p < Flip_Database_2016_01_05_No_Examples.sql

This script will create automatically all needed tables to manage the flip data. Flip is pre-configured with a default admin account whose details are: username: "admin" and password: "edare1". You should be able to change this password easily after running FLIP.

SOFTWARE INSTALLATION AND EXECUTION

Assuming you have installed Apache Tomcat, MYSQL Server and you have run the provided sql script to create the FLIP tables, you just need to download a FlipWeb_"creation_date".war file. Just, choose the latest version and rename it simply as FlipWeb.war. In order that Tomcat7 can automatically recognize this war file, you need to move it to your tomcat7 webapps directory. You DO NOT need to unpack it there.( If you want to examine the source code, just unpack it in another directory).

To test whether or not FlipWeb is running, just run your favorite browser (either firefox or chrome are recommended) and open this url: http://localhost:8080/FlipWeb If this is working properly, you should able to see the FLIP's welcome page.

In case you may want to access any FLIP's source code, you need to unpack the war file, and locate the directory src/
